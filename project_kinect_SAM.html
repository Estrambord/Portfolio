                This is a little game I spent 2 weeks developing with 4 classmates as a school project.

                        The goal of this project was to work with a "VR device", but even though a Kinect might not seem like a very immersive device, the gameplay experience is still pretty intense for a 7 years old technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The keywords for this project were : multisensorial, at the frontier between realities, diegetic. We decided to create a multiplayer experience and increase teamwork by disabling some of the player's senses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Halfway through the project, we had a class on <strong>UX design</strong> that we used to improve our game. We had several people test our app and then fill a user experience questionnaire (we made our own survey based on meCUE and AttrakDiff). This helped us focus on what were the most important changes to make. It was a ood exercise and I'll be using that knowledge in the future for my projects for sure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final result is still lacking some features or bugfixes but we're proud of what we accomplished and the game is very fun to play with friends.
