                During my 6 month internship at AViSTO, I had the opportunity  to join the KARlab team and work on a Mixed Reality app used on a kart race.

                        This project is designed to teach drivers how to interact with vehicles in the future. In 15 years, cars will have new functionalities and we will need some time to become used to them. We begin to see that today with autonomous vehicles, assisted and emergency braking, Heads Up Displays... The KARlab project is here to teach drivers how to adapt to these new technologies by giving them the example of a karting race.

                        I was part of a team of 9, and I worked on the Heads Up Display features using a HoloLens.

            <h3>Obviously I cannot display too much content, but I'll detail below what I worked on during this 6 month internship.</h3>
            <p>The feature I spent the most time developping was the space localisation of the HoloLens. Through Spatial Mapping and World Anchors I managed to display the circuit in the environment. The holograms of the circuits are fixed to the environment and the user can interact with them.</p>
            <p>The other feature that taught me a lot was the TCP communication via Wifi. The kart race app uses a game server that communicates with each kart via Wifi. We used FlatBuffers to send specific messages between every entities. It was very interesting to work on this part.</p>
            <p>Finally I had to make sure not to break what had been done previously, and to document everything to help my coworkers and the future developper on the KARlab project. That required a lot of rigour but it taught me good professionnal practices.</p>
